# Exercise 3: Get started with Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric

### Estimated Duration: 75 Minutes

In this exercise, you'll explore real-time analytics in Microsoft Fabric using Kusto Query Language (KQL). You'll begin by creating a KQL database and importing sales data into a table. Then, you'll run KQL queries to analyze the data and create a query set. Using this query set, you’ll build a Power BI report to visualize results. Finally, you'll simulate real-time data ingestion using Spark Structured Streaming and Delta tables to process and query IoT-like data dynamically.

## Objectives

In this exercise, you will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a KQL database
- Task 2: Use KQL to query the sales table
- Task 3: Create a Power BI report from a KQL Queryset
- Task 4: Use delta tables for streaming data
  
## Task 1: Create a KQL database

In this task, you will create a KQL database to facilitate querying of static or streaming data. You will define a table within the KQL database and ingest sales data from a file to enable effective analysis using Kusto Query Language (KQL).

1. From the left navigation pane, click on **Workspaces (1)** from the left pane and select your workspace **fabric-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**.

1. Click on **+ New item (1)** and in the New item, search for **Eventhouse (2)** and select **Eventhouse (3)** from the **Store data** list.

    ![](./Images/p4t1p2.png)

1. Enter the **Eventhouse name** as **Eventhouse-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** and click on **Create (2)**.

    ![](./Images/p4t1p3.png)

1. In the **Welcome to Eventhouse!** pop-up window, click on **Get started**.

    ![](./Images/p4t1p4.png)

1. Once the Eventhouse is created, click **+ Database (1)** from the top menu to create a new **KQL Database**.

   ![](./Images/E3T1S4-1208.png)

1. Enter the following details:

   - **Database name:** Enter **KQL-Database<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**.

   - Click on **Create (3)**.

     ![](./Images/E3T1S5-1208.png)

1. In the center of the screen, click on **Get data (1)** and then click on **Local file (2)**.

   ![](./Images/p4t1p6.png)

1. Use the wizard to import the data into a new table by selecting the following options:
   
   - **Source:** The local file is the Source. 
   
   - **Configure:**
      - **Database:** *The database you created is already selected*
      - **Table:** Click on **+ New table**.
      - **Name:**  **sales (1)**.
      - **Source type:** File
      - **Upload files:** Drag or Browse for the file from **C:\LabFiles\Files\sales.csv (2)**
      - Click **Next (3)**

        ![01](./Images/e3t1s7.png)

    - **Inspect:** Preview the data, enable **First row header (1)** and click on **Finish (2)**.

        ![01](./Images/e3t1s7.1.png)
       
   - **Summary:**
      - Review the preview of the table and close the wizard.

        ![01](./Images/e3t1s7.2.png)
    
> **Note:** In this example, you imported a very small amount of static data from a file, which is fine for this exercise. In reality, you can use Kusto to analyze much larger volumes of data, including real-time data from a streaming source such as Azure Event Hubs.

## Task 2: Use KQL to query the sales table

In this task, you will use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query the sales table in your KQL database. With the data now available, you can write KQL code to extract insights and perform analysis on the sales data.

1. In the **Eventhouse-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**, make sure you have the **sales** table highlighted. Click on sales **Ellipsis ... (1)** table, select the **Query with code (2)** drop-down, and from there select **Show any 100 records (3)**.

    ![](./Images/E3T2S1-1208.png)

1. A new pane will open with the query and its result. 

    ![](./Images/E3T2S2-1208.png)

1. Modify the query as follows:

    ```kusto
   sales
   | where Item == 'Road-250 Black, 48'
    ```

1. Run the query. Then review the results, which should contain only the rows for sales orders for the *Road-250 Black, 48* product.

    ![](./Images/E4-T2-S4.png)
   
1. Modify the query as follows:

    ```kusto
   sales
   | where Item == 'Road-250 Black, 48'
   | where datetime_part('year', OrderDate) > 2020
    ```

1. Run the query and review the results, which should contain only sales orders for *Road-250 Black, 48* made after 2020.

    ![](./Images/E3T2S6-1208.png)

1. Modify the query as follows:

    ```kusto
   sales
   | where OrderDate between (datetime(2020-01-01 00:00:00) .. datetime(2020-12-31 23:59:59))
   | summarize TotalNetRevenue = sum(UnitPrice) by Item
   | sort by Item asc
    ```

1. Run the query and review the results, which should contain the total net revenue for each product between January 1st and December 31st 2020, in ascending order of product name.

    ![](./Images/E3T2S8-1208.png)

1. From the top select the drop-down next to **KQL-Database<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** and then rename it as **Revenue by Product (2)**.

## Task 4: Use delta tables for streaming data

In this task, you will use Delta tables to handle streaming data, leveraging their capabilities for real-time data processing. Specifically, you will implement a Delta table as a sink for streaming data in a simulated Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, utilizing the Spark Structured Streaming API.

1. Navigate back to your **fabric-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** workspace and open **Load Sales Notebook (2)**.

    ![](./Images/p4t4p1.png)

1. Add a new code cell in the notebook using **+ Code (1)**. Then, in the new cell, add the following code **(2)** and click on the run cell icon **(3)**:

   ![](./Images/E3T4S2.png)

   ```python
   from notebookutils import mssparkutils
   from pyspark.sql.types import *
   from pyspark.sql.functions import *

   # Create a folder
   inputPath = 'Files/delta/'
   mssparkutils.fs.mkdirs(inputPath)

   # Create a stream that reads data from the folder, using a JSON schema
   jsonSchema = StructType([
   StructField("device", StringType(), False),
   StructField("status", StringType(), False)
   ])
   iotstream = spark.readStream.schema(jsonSchema).option("maxFilesPerTrigger", 1).json(inputPath)

   # Write some event data to the folder
   device_data = '''{"device":"Dev1","status":"ok"}
   {"device":"Dev1","status":"ok"}
   {"device":"Dev1","status":"ok"}
   {"device":"Dev2","status":"error"}
   {"device":"Dev1","status":"ok"}
   {"device":"Dev1","status":"error"}
   {"device":"Dev2","status":"ok"}
   {"device":"Dev2","status":"error"}
   {"device":"Dev1","status":"ok"}'''
   mssparkutils.fs.put(inputPath + "data.txt", device_data, True)
   print("Source stream created...")
   ```

    ![](./Images/E3T4S2-1208.png)
          
1. Ensure the message *Source stream created...* is printed. The code you just ran has created a streaming data source based on a folder to which some data has been saved, representing readings from hypothetical IoT devices.

    ![](./Images/E3T4S3-1208.png)

1. Add a new code cell by clicking on **+ Code (1)**. Add the following code **(2)** and click on the run cell icon **(3)**. This code writes the streaming device data in delta format to a folder named **iotdevicedata**. Because the path for the folder location is in the **Tables** folder, a table will automatically be created for it.

    ```python
   # Write the stream to a delta table
   delta_stream_table_path = 'Tables/dbo/iotdevicedata'
   checkpointpath = 'Files/delta'
   deltastream = iotstream.writeStream.format("delta").option("checkpointLocation", checkpointpath).start(delta_stream_table_path)
   print("Streaming to delta sink...")
    ```

    ![](./Images/E3T2S4-1803.png)

1. Add a new code cell by clicking on **+ Code (1)**. Add the following code **(2)** and click on the run cell icon **(3)**. This code queries the **IotDeviceData** table, which contains the device data from the streaming source. 

    ```SQL
   %%sql

   SELECT * FROM IotDeviceData;
    ```
    
    ![](./Images/E3T4S7-1208.png)

>Note: If you encounter an error indicating that the IOTDeviceData table is not found after running the above command, execute the command below to create the table. Once the table is created, re-run the previous step :
`SELECT * FROM IOTDeviceData;`

```SQL
%%sql

CREATE TABLE iotdevicedata
USING DELTA
LOCATION 'Tables/dbo/iotdevicedata';
```

1. Add a new code cell by clicking on **+ Code**. Add the following code and click on the run cell icon. This code writes more hypothetical device data to the streaming source.

    ```python
   # Add more data to the source stream
   more_data = '''{"device":"Dev1","status":"ok"}
   {"device":"Dev1","status":"ok"}
   {"device":"Dev1","status":"ok"}
   {"device":"Dev1","status":"ok"}
   {"device":"Dev1","status":"error"}
   {"device":"Dev2","status":"error"}
   {"device":"Dev1","status":"ok"}'''

   mssparkutils.fs.put(inputPath + "more-data.txt", more_data, True)
    ```

1. Re-run the cell containing the code below. This code queries the **IotDeviceData** table again, which should now include the additional data that was added to the streaming source.

    ```SQL
   %%sql

   SELECT * FROM IotDeviceData;
    ```

    ![](./Images/E3T4S11-1208.png)

1. Add a new code cell, and run the following code:

    ```python
   deltastream.stop()
    ```

    >**Note:** This code stops the stream.

1. Click the **Stop** icon in the top menu bar to halt the notebook.

    > **Note:** Make sure the session is stopped, otherwise the new notebooks doesn't work.
