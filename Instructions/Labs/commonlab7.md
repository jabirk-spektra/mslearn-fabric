# Lab 01: Create a Fabric workspace

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

Microsoft Fabric lets you set up workspaces depending on your workflows and use cases. A workspace is where you can collaborate with others to create reports, notebooks, lakehouses, etc. 
This lab will introduce you to creating a workspace in Microsoft Fabric. You will learn how to set up a workspace, which serves as a collaborative environment for organizing and managing your projects, data, and resources.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Assign Fabric Administrator Role
- Task 2: Sign up for Microsoft Fabric Trial
- Task 3: Create a workspace
- Task 4: Create a Lakehouse and upload files
