    ![](./Images/01/E1T5S5.png)  

1. Select the previously created **Lakehouse_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** then click **Add (2)**.
 
    ![](./Images/img-15.png) 

1. Select the existing cell in the notebook, clear the default code, and replace it with the **variable declaration (1)** below. Then click **&#9655; Run (2)** to execute the cell.

    ```python
   table_name = "sales"
    ```

   ![11](./Images/01/Pg3-Notebook-S2.png) 

    > **Note**: Since this is the first time you've run any Spark code in this session, the Spark pool must be started. This means that the first cell can take a minute or so to complete.

1. In the **Ellipsis (...) (1)** menu for the cell (at its top-right) select **Toggle parameter cell (2)**. This configures the cell so that the variables declared in it are treated as parameters when running the notebook from a pipeline.

     ![](./Images/e1p2t5p7.png)

1. Under the parameters cell, use the **+ Code** button to add a new code cell. 

     ![](./Images/E1T5S8-1108.png) 

   >**Note:** You might have to hover your mouse below the output to view the **+ Code** option.

1. Add the following code to it:

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.functions import *
    
    # Read the new sales data
    df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header","true").option("inferSchema","true").load("Files/new_data/*.csv")

    ## Add month and year columns
    df = df.withColumn("Year", year(col("OrderDate"))).withColumn("Month", month(col("OrderDate")))

    # Derive FirstName and LastName columns
    df = df.withColumn("FirstName", split(col("CustomerName"), " ").getItem(0)).withColumn("LastName", split(col("CustomerName"), " ").getItem(1))

    # Filter and reorder columns
    df = df["SalesOrderNumber", "SalesOrderLineNumber", "OrderDate", "Year", "Month", "FirstName", "LastName", "EmailAddress", "Item", "Quantity", "UnitPrice", "TaxAmount"]

    # Load the data into a managed table
    #Managed tables are tables for which both the schema metadata and the data files are managed by Fabric. The data files for the table are created in the Tables folder.
    df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable(table_name)
    ```

     ![](./Images/code1.png) 

    This code loads the data from the sales.csv file that was ingested by the **Copy Data** activity, applies some transformation logic, and saves the transformed data as a **managed table** - appending the data if the table already exists.

1. Verify that your notebooks look similar to the one shown in the image below, and then use the **&#9655; Run all** button on the toolbar to run all of the cells it contains.

    ![Screenshot of a notebook with a parameters cell and code to transform data.](./Images/E1T5S11.png)

## Task 6: Use SQL to query tables

In this task, you'll use SQL to query tables in a database. You'll write statements to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data, helping you analyze the dataset and build your SQL skills.

1. At the top-right of the Lakehouse page, switch from **Lakehouse** to **SQL analytics endpoint (1)**.

    ![.](./Images/Lake19.png)
    > **Note**:Please wait a short time until the SQL query endpoint for your lakehouse opens in a visual interface from which you can query its tables

1. Use the **New SQL query** button to open a new query editor, and enter the following SQL query:

    ```SQL
   SELECT Item, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Revenue
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY Item
   ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
    ```

    ![](./Images/01/E1T6S2.png)

1. Use the **&#9655; Run** button to run the query and view the results, which should show the total revenue for each product.

    ![](./Images/E2-T5-S3.png)

## Task 7: Create a visual query

In this task, you'll create a visual query in Power BI using Power Query. Start by adding the Sales table to the query editor, select the necessary columns, and applying a Group By transformation to count distinct line items per sales order. Then, review the summarized results.

1. On the toolbar under **New SQL query (1)** drop-down select **New visual query (2)**.

    ![](./Images/p1t7p1.png)

1. In the Lakehouse, navigate to **Schemas**, then to **dbo**, expand the **tables** folder and select the **sales** table. In the sales table, click on **Ellipsis &#8230; (1)** and select **Insert into canvas (2)**. It is in the new visual query editor pane that opens to create a Power Query. 

    ![](./Images/p1t7p2.png)

    ![Account-manager-start](./Images/E1T7S3-1108.png)

    ![Account-manager-start](./Images/E1T7S3.1-1108.png)

1. Click on **Transform table (1)** menu, select **Group by (2)**.

    ![](./Images/E1T7S4.png)

1. Then group the data by using the following **Basic** settings.
   
   - Group by: **SalesOrderNumber (1)**
   - New column name: **LineItems (2)**
   - Operation: **Count distinct values (3)**
   - Column: **SalesOrderLineNumber (4)**
   - Click **OK (5)**

     ![](./Images/p1t7p5.png)

     >**Note:** If you are unable to select **Column**, click **OK** and proceed to the next steps.

1. When you're done, the results pane under the visual query shows the number of line items for each sales order.

    ![Screenshot of a Visual query with results.](./Images/E2-T6-S6.png)

## Task 8: Create a report

In this task, you'll create a report to visualize your data findings. You'll select relevant data, choose appropriate visuals, and organize the report to clearly present insights and support data-driven decisions.

1. First, we will need to create a Semantic model. At the top of the SQL analytics endpoint page, select the **New semantic model** tab.
    
    ![](./Images/e1p2t8p1.png)

2. Provide the Direct Lake semantic model name as **Lakehouse_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** and select **sales (2)** table from the list. Click on **Confirm (3)**.

    ![](./Images/semanticmodel_1.png)

3. Go back to the **fabric-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** workspace from the left pane. Select recently created semantic model named as **Lakehouse_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**

    ![](./Images/e1p2t8p3.png)

4. Click on **Open(1)** to view the table in semantic model.

   ![](./Images/01/E1T8S4.png)

7. In the **Data** pane on the right, expand the **sales** table. Then select the following fields:
   
   - **Item (1)**
   - **Quantity (2)**
   - Then, a **Table visualization (3)** is added to the report.

        ![](./Images/p1t8p7.png)

8. Hide the **Data** and **Filters** panes to create more space if required. Then, make sure the **Table visualization is selected (1)** and in the **Visualizations** pane, change the visualization to a **Clustered bar chart (2)** and resize it as shown here.

   ![](./Images/p1t8p8.png)

   ![Screenshot of a report containing a clustered bar chart.](./Images/E2-T7-S5a.png)

9. On the **File (1)** menu, select **Save As (2)**. Then, name the Report as **Item Sales Report (3)** and click **Save (4)** in the workspace you created previously.
